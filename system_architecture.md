# Natasha AI Penetration Testing Tool - System Architecture

## Overview
Natasha is an AI-powered penetration testing tool designed for educational purposes, running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with a Waveshare 2.13-inch e-paper display. The system combines hardware-based attacks (USB Rubber Ducky functionality) with wireless attacks (WiFi Pineapple functionality) and uses AI to generate attack scripts and adapt to different target environments.

## Hardware Components
- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W**: Core computing platform
  - Quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 @ 1GHz
  - 512MB LPDDR2 RAM
  - Built-in 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g/n wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.2
  - USB OTG port for HID emulation
  - microSD card slot for storage
  
- **Waveshare 2.13-inch e-Paper Display V4**:
  - 250×122 pixel resolution
  - Black and white display
  - SPI interface
  - Low power consumption
  
- **Additional Hardware**:
  - External USB WiFi adapter (for dedicated wireless attacks)
  - Buttons for user interface navigation
  - LED indicators for status feedback
  - Battery pack for portable operation

## Software Architecture

### Operating System Layer
- **Kali Linux ARM** (or Raspberry Pi OS with Kali tools)
  - Provides base system and networking capabilities
  - Includes necessary penetration testing tools
  - Manages hardware interfaces

### Core Services Layer
- **HID Emulation Service**
  - Manages USB Rubber Ducky functionality
  - Handles keyboard emulation for payload delivery
  - Interfaces with the AI for script generation
  
- **Wireless Attack Service**
  - Manages WiFi scanning, monitoring, and attack capabilities
  - Handles deauthentication attacks
  - Implements evil twin AP functionality
  - Manages packet capture and analysis
  
- **E-Paper Display Service**
  - Manages the Waveshare e-paper display
  - Renders UI elements and status information
  - Handles refresh timing and display updates

### AI Engine Layer
- **Local AI Model**
  - Lightweight model for offline operation
  - Generates DuckyScript payloads based on target OS
  - Adapts attack strategies based on environment
  - Processes natural language commands for attack customization
  
- **Script Generation Engine**
  - Creates DuckyScript payloads for various attack scenarios
  - Customizes payloads based on target OS detection
  - Optimizes scripts for different environments

### Application Layer
- **User Interface**
  - Character-based interface featuring "Natasha"
  - Menu system for attack selection and configuration
  - Status indicators and feedback mechanisms
  
- **Attack Modules**
  - Credential harvesting
  - Keylogging
  - Backdoor generation
  - WiFi network scanning and analysis
  - Man-in-the-middle attacks
  - Automated vulnerability scanning

## Data Flow

1. **User Input** → **UI Layer** → **Attack Selection**
2. **Attack Selection** → **AI Engine** → **Script Generation**
3. **Script Generation** → **Core Services** → **Attack Execution**
4. **Attack Execution** → **Data Collection** → **Results Processing**
5. **Results Processing** → **UI Layer** → **User Feedback**

## Security Considerations
- All generated scripts and attacks are for educational purposes only
- System includes safeguards to prevent unauthorized use
- Clear documentation on ethical usage guidelines
- Logging of all activities for accountability

## Extensibility
- Modular design allows for adding new attack modules
- API for integrating additional AI capabilities
- Support for hardware expansions (additional sensors, interfaces)
- Plugin system for community-contributed modules
