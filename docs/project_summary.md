# Natasha AI Penetration Testing Tool - Project Summary

## Overview
Natasha is an AI-powered penetration testing tool designed for educational purposes. It combines the capabilities of a USB Rubber Ducky and WiFi Pineapple into a single, portable device powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with a Waveshare 2.13-inch e-paper display.

## Completed Components

### Core Components
- **Display Interface**: Implemented a Python module for the Waveshare 2.13-inch e-paper display with a character-based "Natasha" avatar and intuitive menu system.
- **AI Engine**: Created an AI component for generating DuckyScript payloads based on target OS detection with template-based script generation and fallback options.
- **HID Emulation**: Developed a USB HID emulation module for Rubber Ducky functionality with comprehensive keyboard mapping and DuckyScript command parsing.
- **WiFi Attack Module**: Implemented WiFi scanning, monitoring, and attack capabilities including deauthentication, evil twin, and captive portal functionality.
- **MITM Attack Module**: Created a man-in-the-middle attack framework with ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, SSL stripping, packet capture, and session hijacking capabilities.
- **Main Application**: Developed the main application that integrates all components with a state-based UI navigation system.

### Attack Capabilities
- **USB Attacks**:
  - Credential Harvesting: Templates for extracting stored credentials from Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - Keylogging: OS-specific keyloggers for capturing keystrokes
  - Backdoor Generation: Persistent remote access capabilities for all major operating systems
  - System Reconnaissance: Information gathering scripts

- **WiFi Attacks**:
  - Network Scanning: Advanced scanning and analysis of nearby wireless networks
  - Deauthentication: Disconnect clients from their associated access points
  - Evil Twin: Create rogue access points mimicking legitimate networks
  - Captive Portal: Deploy phishing captive portals for credential harvesting
  - Handshake Capture: Capture WPA/WPA2 handshakes for offline password cracking
  - PMKID Attacks: Capture PMKID hashes without client interaction

- **MITM Attacks**:
  - ARP Spoofing: Intercept traffic between targets
  - DNS Spoofing: Redirect domains to malicious IPs
  - SSL Strip: Downgrade HTTPS to HTTP
  - Packet Capture: Capture and analyze network traffic
  - Session Hijacking: Hijack user sessions by capturing cookies

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Detailed system architecture documentation
- Hardware design specifications
- Attack module design documentation
- Installation script for automated setup

## System Architecture
The Natasha AI Penetration Testing Tool follows a modular architecture:

1. **Hardware Layer**: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with Waveshare e-paper display
2. **Operating System Layer**: Kali Linux ARM
3. **Core Services Layer**: HID Emulation, Wireless Attack, E-Paper Display, MITM Attack
4. **AI Engine Layer**: Local AI Model, Script Generation Engine
5. **Application Layer**: User Interface, Attack Modules

## Installation and Setup
The tool includes an installation script (`install.sh`) that automates the setup process:
1. Installs required system dependencies
2. Configures the e-paper display
3. Sets up USB HID emulation
4. Installs attack tools and libraries
5. Creates necessary directories and files
6. Configures autostart services

## Ethical Considerations
The tool is designed for educational purposes only and includes:
- Clear documentation on ethical usage guidelines
- Warnings about unauthorized use
- Logging of all activities for accountability
- Focus on educational value rather than exploitation

## Future Enhancements
While the core functionality is complete, future enhancements could include:
- Automated vulnerability scanning module
- Voice feedback system
- Support for additional hardware peripherals
- Mobile companion app
- Cloud-based attack template repository

## Conclusion
The Natasha AI Penetration Testing Tool successfully combines USB Rubber Ducky and WiFi Pineapple functionality with AI-driven attack script generation in a compact, portable device. It provides a comprehensive platform for security education and authorized penetration testing.
