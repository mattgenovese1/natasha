# Natasha UI/UX Design for E-Paper Display

## Overview
The user interface for Natasha is designed to be both functional and engaging, featuring a character-based interface with "Natasha" as the AI assistant. The UI is optimized for the Waveshare 2.13-inch e-paper display (250×122 pixels, black and white) while providing an intuitive and efficient user experience.

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity**: Information must be clearly visible on the small e-paper display
2. **Efficiency**: Navigation should require minimal button presses
3. **Character-Driven**: Natasha's personality should be present throughout the interface
4. **Responsive**: UI should provide clear feedback despite e-paper refresh limitations
5. **Accessible**: Text and icons must be legible in various lighting conditions

## Character Design: Natasha

### Visual Elements
- Minimalist line-art style suitable for e-paper display
- Distinctive hairstyle and facial features
- Various expressions (normal, thinking, success, warning)
- Small enough to not dominate screen space

### Personality Elements
- Professional but with subtle humor
- Provides guidance and suggestions
- Responds to system events with appropriate expressions
- Uses concise, technical language

## Animation and Transitions
Despite e-paper limitations, create sense of responsiveness through:
- Strategic partial refreshes for UI elements
- Loading indicators that work well with e-paper
- Inverted elements to indicate selection/focus
- Progress bars for longer operations

## Text and Typography
- **Primary Font**: 5x7 pixel font for maximum legibility
- **Secondary Font**: 3x5 pixel font for status indicators
- **Maximum Characters Per Line**: ~30 characters (main content area)
- **Text Contrast**: Pure black on white for maximum readability

## Icons and Visual Elements
- Simple, high-contrast icons (8x8 or 12x12 pixels)
- Consistent visual language across interface
- Status indicators: battery, signal strength, attack type
- Progress indicators optimized for e-paper display

## User Experience Flows

## E-Paper Display Optimization

### Refresh Strategy
- Full refresh: Only when changing major screens
- Partial refresh: For menu navigation, status updates
- Text-only updates: For minimal visual disruption

### Power Efficiency
- Sleep mode when inactive for >30 seconds
- Critical information remains visible in low-power mode
- Minimal refreshes during attack execution

## Accessibility Considerations
- High contrast for all UI elements
- No reliance on color for critical information
- Tactile feedback to complement visual feedback
- Consistent button mapping across screens

## Implementation Notes
- Use buffered drawing to minimize screen flicker
- Pre-render complex elements to reduce drawing time
- Implement efficient text rendering for smooth scrolling
- Cache common UI elements to improve responsiveness
